# True Accompaniment Doctrine

## Non-Negotiables
- Beat must follow vocal phrasing and section energy.
- Style coherence over novelty.
- Mix hierarchy remains stable: vocal first, groove foundation second, musical layers third.
- Variation is intentional at transitions, not random every bar.

## Decision Order
1. Detect flow grid (onsets, bar density, phrase boundaries).
2. Classify sections (intro/verse/hook/break/outro).
3. Resolve style profile and compatible assets.
4. Arrange drums/bass/harmony/melody by section rules.
5. Apply doctrine mix checks.

## Pass/Fail Checks
- Section contrast present.
- No single layer dominates unexpectedly.
- Repetition score within target bounds.
- Export includes arrangement debug map.
